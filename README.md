# UT Austin Course 2, Task 3
 Multiple Regression in R

Hello,

The sales team has again consulted with me with some concerns about ongoing product sales in one of our stores. Specifically, they have been tracking the sales performance of specific product types and would like us to redo our previous sales prediction analysis, but this time they'd like us to include the ‘product type’ attribute in our predictions to better understand how specific product types perform against each other. They have asked our team to analyze historical sales data and then make sales volume predictions for a list of new product types, some of which are also from a previous task. This will help the sales team better understand how types of products might impact sales across the enterprise.

I have attached historical sales data and new product data sets to this email. I would like for you to do the analysis with the goals of:

Predicting sales of four different product types: PC, Laptops, Netbooks and Smartphones
Assessing the impact services reviews and customer reviews have on sales of different product types
When you have completed your analysis, please submit a brief report that includes the methods you employed and your results. I would also like to see the results exported from R for each of the methods.

Thanks,

Danielle
